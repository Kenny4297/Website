## Description
Kedgard Cordero's personal website! Learn more about me, and contact me if you wish!

## Motivation
I wanted to push myself and create a better personal website, other than the website that they have you do in the Minnesota Coding Bootcamp. There were many restrictions on that portfolio, and I knew that I could do better! 

## Technologies
Styled-components:
Styled-components is a popular CSS-in-JS library for React that allows you to write CSS code directly in your JavaScript code. It provides a more intuitive and component-based way of styling React components, allowing you to keep your styles closely tied to your components. This makes it easier to maintain and refactor your code, and allows for greater flexibility and dynamic styling.

React-icons:
React-icons is a library of popular icons that can be easily integrated into your React projects. It provides a collection of over 1,000 icons from popular icon sets such as Font Awesome, Material Icons, and Ionicons, all of which can be easily used in your React components. This library can save time and effort in finding and integrating icons into your projects, and helps ensure consistency across your UI.

React-Slick:
React-Slick is a popular carousel component for React that allows you to easily create a responsive carousel or slider for your website. It provides a number of useful features, such as lazy loading, infinite scrolling, and touch swipe support, and can be easily customized to fit your design needs. Compared to the carousel component from react-bootstrap, React-Slick is more flexible and customizable, and provides a wider range of features.

React-Reveal:
React Reveal is a React library for creating animations on web pages. It allows you to add animation effects to your React components easily and without writing complex CSS animations. I have used this library in previous projects and decided to use it again here because of its clean animations.

## Features
Visitors can view my previous work, see recommendations made by others, can contact me through email if they wish.

## Deployment
--Comming soon--

## Troubleshooting
So far the project has been coming along smoothly! This is my first time using 'styled-components', and it is difficult to spot errors in the CSS section, due to the styling being a string, and not actual CSS. I resolved this by installing the extension 'vscode-styled-components', and extension that turns the original text into color coordinated CSS styling. This makes it easier for me to spot mistakes and results in cleaner code.

## Testing
My goal is to use jest for testing, in the following ways:
EmailJS Integration, Website Layout, Load Time, Accessibility, and error Error Handling. These may change throughout the development process.

If you have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to share them with me.
