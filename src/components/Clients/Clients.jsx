The platform's seamless structure and flow allowed me to progress through the fundamentals of C++ effortlessly. It not only taught me syntax and language features but also instilled problem-solving skills and a logical approach to programming. The lessons, quizzes, challenges, along with the code examples and detailed explanations enhanced my learning experience and I was able to grasp these concepts quickly. Thanks to "Learn C++," I gained a solid foundation in C++ and the confidence to tackle new concepts and challenges independently. I recommend Ked to anyone looking for a talented and experienced developer who can build exceptional websites that meet their specific needs and exceed their expectations. With Ked's expertise in web development, attention to detail, and commitment to delivering high-quality results, clients can trust that their website will be thoughtfully designed, visually appealing, and user-friendly.`,

I donâ€™t quite understand what he did when he told me, but the changes he made to the site's architecture led to a noticeable improvement in loading times.

        Despite our challenges to balance the guidelines and to keep the original color scheme, Ked professionally let me know that we had to modify the colors in order to meet website color guidelines. 
        
        His patience with me, technical skills, and dedication to customer satisfaction were extraordinary. I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of a web developer who doesn't just "do" the job but does it exceptionally well.

The course was full-time, and required 5+ hours per day of in-class time, plus a great deal of evening and weekend work. Lessons were fast-paced and students had to be able to learn at a brisk pace and adapt quickly.

        Ked is one of the brightest students I've ever taught, and he had no trouble absorbing most of the material at a very fast pace. When he had questions, they were insightful and showed an active mind. He also went above and beyond during the group project work, showing skills far beyond most developers at this stage. He's also an outstanding group member, and was always ready to help other students. He would be a fantastic addition to any dev team.`,

His proficiency, methodical approach, and clear communication were commendable. I highly recommend him for his skills in web development and his dedication to clear client communication.`,
